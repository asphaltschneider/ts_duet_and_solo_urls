For grabbing a client id and a secret, you need to register a application on
https://dev.twitch.tv/console

for oauth, you can just enter http://localhost

Then you can see your client id
and generate a secret.

don't forget to fill in these 3 into the python script.

TWITCH_USERNAME = "<YOUR_NAME_ON_TWITCH>"

CLIENT_ID = "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"

CLIENT_SECRET = "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
